1. Installation of raspberry pi
- download the right image from side (each hardware platform is different)
- when dd the image on to the SD card, make sure use the right bloack size (512K seems works for Pi-zero kali image)

2. Design of raspberry pi:
- The pi should work as a wifi router and wifi client at same time with onboard Wifi interface
- First, we need to disable the NetworkManager (multiple services) including
    sudo systemctl stop NetworkManager-wait-online.service
    sudo systemctl disable NetworkManager-wait-online.service

    sudo systemctl stop NetworkManager-dispatcher.service
    sudo systemctl disable NetworkManager-dispatcher.service

    sudo systemctl stop network-manager.service
    sudo systemctl disable network-manager.service

- Secondly, make a virtual interface (wlan0ap) to run hostapd (it has be run before the managed interface)
  The detial is in ~/bin/setup_wifi.sh which is root's cron job.

- Third Start up the main interface wlan0 with wpa_supplicant to attached available wifi network and get DHCP IP by dhclient.

- Forth, run autossh to hkzbox to setup reverse forwarding for remote access
  - need to setup root account's ssh config and copy right key files from hkzbox
  - the key file can be generated without password protection

- the step 2 to 4 is scripted and scheduled as a crontab
  @reboot sleep 30 && /root/bin/setup_wifi.sh > /dev/null

3. Each of above config will saved for reference
